## Usage
The list shows what steps were made to complete the challenge:
- The portfolio contains these components - App, Navigation bar, Home page, About me page, Projects page and Contact page.
- I used mobile-first design.
- The app has links to my LinkedIn Profile, GitHub Profile, email address, CV and 6 projects(links to deployed website and GitHub repo).
- The App has all components and render all necessary child components.
- When the app is open the "Home" page is displayed by default.
- The Home page is has welcoming message to my website, my name, my role (animated design) and social media icons leading to my social media accounts.
- The Header is rendering across every page component of the site and contains a Navbar.
- The Navbar is using "burger menu" when the page size is shrinked.
- The Project page has six projects , which contain - project title, link to deployed website, GitHub repo and an image. When the user clicks on the project , it is leading them to different page with more information about the skills that I used and where the user can find the full code for the project.
